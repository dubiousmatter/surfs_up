# Surfs Up

## Overview
We performed an analysis of weather patterns for the island of Oahu in order to determine whether opening an ice cream/surf shop would be feasible. After presenting the board with precipitation research, they requested more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, they want temperature data for the months of June and December on Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results
In order to determine if the business could be year-round, we looked at all of the temps in our database from the months of June and December. After extracting the data for those two months, we formulated the summary statistics for each.

December summary statistics.

Research takeaways:
- Average temps were very similar at 75 for June and 71 for December
- Max temps were also very similar at 85 for June and 83 for December
- The largest difference came from the minimum temps which were 64 for June and 56 for December

## Summary
As a result of our analysis we are confident that a surf and ice cream shop could be a year-round business since low temperatures are in a similar range and those lows are more likely to occur at night. We would be interested in performing queries that would show rainfall for both months as well as wind speeds. Both of those factors may have an impact on traffic patterns.
